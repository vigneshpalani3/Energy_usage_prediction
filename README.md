# Energy Usage Prediction

This project aims to predict energy consumption using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing and model building to forecast energy usage based on historical data.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `Data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.
- `model_building.ipynb`: Notebook for training and evaluating machine learning models.

## 📊 Dataset

*Note: Please provide details about the dataset used, including the source, features, and any preprocessing steps applied.*

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature selection and engineering
   - Data normalization or scaling

2. **Model Building**:
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets
   - Training machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees)
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R²

## 📈 Results

*Note: Summarize the performance of the models tested, highlighting the best-performing model and its evaluation metrics.*

## 📌 Future Work
